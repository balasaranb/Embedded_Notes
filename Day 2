*Parallel:
8_bit data transfer the same time.

*Serial:
8_bit data tansfer one bit at the time.

  SERIAL DATA COMMUNICATION USES TWO METHODS:

*SYNCHRONOUS:
Clock is transmiited with the data

  *ASYNCHRONOUS:
  No clock is transmitted.Transmitter and receiver agree on the clock speed for the data transmisson.(Baudrate).

  UART:
  Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter.

  USART:
Universal Synchronous Receiver/Transmitter.

  DUPLEX:
Data can be transmitted and received.

  SIMPLEX:
Data can be trasmitted only or received only.i.e.one direction only.

  HALF DUPLEX:
Data can be transmitted in only one way at a time.

  FULL DUPLEX:
  Data can be transmitted in both ways at a time.

  In Asynchronous transmisson,each byte(character)is packed between start and stop bits.
  *Start bit is always 1 bit,the value of the start bit is always 0.
  *Stop bit can be 1 0r 2 bits,the value of the stop bit is always 1.
