SINGLE BOARD COMPUTER:
   The usageof System On Module over a System On Chip is the most rapid way to achieve time to market, 
curtail development risks for product quantities ranging from few to thousands. 
RuggedBoard team targets to combine the Open Source Community strength with Industrial-Grade SOM and 
initiated the first Open Source Hardware "RuggedBoard-A5D2x" which is powered by phyCORE-A5D2 SOM with 
Microchip SAMA5D2x SoC, Cortex-A5 Core @500 MHz
SOC:
   SoC stands for System On Chip. It is a small integrated chip that contains all the required components 
and circuits of a particular system. The components of SoC include CPU, GPU, Memory, I/O devices, etc. 
SoC is used in various devices such as smartphones, Internet of Things appliances, tablets, and embedded 
system applications.In this article, we are going to see the architecture and architectural features of SoC.

  A5D2X:
    RuggedBoard - A5D2x is an Single Board Computer providing as easy migration path from Microcontroller
  to Microprocessor.  RuggedBoard is enabled with industry Standard Yocto Build Embedded Linux platform and
 open source libraries for industrial application development.

SOM:
     phyCORE-A5D2x usually includes drivers and/or software for controlling all components such as interfaces, 
memory, etc. Therefore, programming close to hardware at register level is not necessary in most cases. 
For this reason, this manual contains no detailed description of the controller's registers, or 
information relevant for software development.
